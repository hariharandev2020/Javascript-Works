The main problem that I want you to solve is printing a calendar for a specific month of 2021.

Phase 1:
- Jan 1, 2021 falls on Friday
- So which day does January 19 falls? which day does March 12 falls? - Find it out first.

Phase 2:
- Have a variable to store the month say 
             var month = 1 means January. 
             month = 2 means February. 

- Store the days of each month in an array [31,28,31,30.............]
- Find which day does the 1st day of the month is falling... It can be Monday or Sunday or any day. 
- Start the Day-1 of the month on that particular day and loop it through the number of days in the month. 
- Highlight Saturdays and Sundays in Red color
